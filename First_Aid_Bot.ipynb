            "['Cardiac EmergenciesIntroduction In this chapter, you will learn how to recognize and give care for a person who is having a heart attack or who  is experiencing cardiac arrest, which are among the most common cardiac emergencies. This chapter also discusses risk factors for cardiovascular disease—the leading cause of cardiac emergencies—and what you can do to control those risks. Cardiovascular Disease Cardiovascular disease is an abnormal condition that affects the heart and blood vessels. It is the number one killer in the United States and is a major cause of disability. Cardiovascular disease causes coronary heart  disease (CHD),  also known as coronary artery disease. People with cardiovascular disease are likely also to  have disease of other blood vessels, which can cause strokes. More information about stroke is included in Chapter 15. CHD occurs when the coronary arteries  that supply blood to the heart muscle harden and narrow in a process  called atherosclerosis.  The damage occurs gradually, as cholesterol  and fatty deposits called plaque build  up on the inner artery walls. As this buildup worsens, the arteries become narrower. This reduces the amount of blood that can flow through the arteries, and prevents the heart from getting the blood and oxygen it needs. If the heart does not get blood containing oxygen, it will not work properly. CHD accounts for about half of the cardiovascular-disease-related deaths in adult Americans each year. Because atherosclerosis develops gradually, it can remain undetected for many years. Most people with atherosclerosis are unaware they have it. Fortunately, atherosclerosis can be slowed or stopped by taking steps to reduce risk factors  and adopting a healthy lifestyle. Risk Factors for Coronary Heart Disease Many things increase a person’s chances of developing CHD. These are called risk factors. Some risk  factors cannot be changed. For instance, although more women than men die each year from CHD in the United States, heart disease generally affects men at younger ages than it does women. Ethnicity also plays a role in determining the risk for heart disease. African-American and Native American populations statistically have higher rates of heart disease than do other U.S. populations. A family history of heart disease also increases the risk. The good news is that some risk factors for CHD can be reduced. Cigarette smoking, a poor diet,  uncontrolled high blood cholesterol or high blood pressure, excessive weight and lack of regular exercise all increase the risk of heart disease. When individuals exhibit multiple risk factors, the risk of heart attack is much greater. Appropriate steps can be taken to control these risk factors—such as quitting smoking, eating healthier, exercising regularly and following the care prescribed by a healthcare provider—all to improve one’s chances for living a long and healthy life.KEY TERMS Risk factors:  Conditions or behaviors that increase the chance that a person will develop a disease. Ventricular fibrillation (V-fib):  A life-threatening heart rhythm in which the heart is in a state of  totally disorganized electrical activity, and does not pump blood effectively. Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach):  A life-threatening heart rhythm in which there is very rapid  contraction of the ventricles (the lower chambers of the heart), causing the heart to pump blood ineffectively or not at all.continued'\n",
            " 'Cardiac EmergenciesHeart Attack A heart attack  occurs when blood flow to part  of the heart muscle is blocked (e.g., as a result of coronary artery disease). Because the cells in the affected area of the heart muscle are not receiving the oxygen and nutrients they need, they die, causing permanent damage to the heart muscle (Figure 6-1). Seeking advanced medical care as soon as you recognize the signs and symptoms of a heart attack can minimize the damage to the heart and may save the person’s life. When a person is having a heart attack,  every minute counts. Signs and Symptoms  of a Heart Attack Signs and symptoms of a heart attack vary from  person to person, and can be different in women than they are in men. Even people who have had a heart attack before may not experience the same signs and symptoms if they have a second heart attack. A person who is having a heart attack may show any of the following signs and symptoms:  QChest pain, which can range from mild to unbearable. The person may complain of pressure, squeezing,  tightness, aching or heaviness in the chest. The pain or discomfort is persistent, lasting longer than 3 to 5 minutes, or going away and then coming back. It is not relieved by resting, changing position or taking medication. It may be difficult to distinguish the pain of a heart attack from the pain of indigestion, heartburn or a muscle spasm.  QDiscomfort or pain that spreads to one or both arms, the back, the shoulder, the neck, the jaw or the  upper part of the stomach  QDizziness or light-headedness  QTrouble breathing, including noisy breathing, shortness of breath or breathing that is faster than normal  QNausea or vomiting  QPale, ashen (gray) or slightly bluish skin, especially around the face and fingers  QSweating  QA feeling of anxiety or impending doom  QExtreme fatigue (tiredness)  QUnresponsiveness Heart Attack Although men often have the “classic” signs and symptoms of a heart attack, such as chest pain that radiates  down one arm, women often have more subtle signs and symptoms or experience the signs and symptoms of a heart attack differently than men do (Figure 6-2). For example, in women, the “classic” signs and symptoms  Blockage inthe artery Damaged heart muscle Figure 6-1.  A heart attack occurs when blood flow to the heart  is blocked.'\n",
            " 'Cardiac Emergenciesmay be milder or accompanied by more general signs and symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea  or vomiting, extreme fatigue, and dizziness or light-headedness. Because these signs and symptoms are so general and nonspecific, women may experience them for hours, days or even weeks leading up to the heart attack but dismiss them as nothing out of the ordinary. The signs and symptoms of a heart attack may also be more subtle in people with certain medical conditions  such as diabetes. First Aid Care for a Heart Attack If you think that a person is having a heart attack, call 9-1-1 or the designated emergency number immediately. Trust your instincts. Many people who are having a heart attack delay seeking care because they hope they are experiencing signs and symptoms of a more minor condition that will go away with time, such as indigestion, heartburn, a muscle strain or the flu. People often worry about calling an ambulance and going to the emergency room for a “false alarm.” However, most people who die of a heart attack die within 2 hours of first experiencing signs or symptoms. Even when a heart attack is not fatal, early advanced medical care can help to minimize the damage to the heart. Always seek advanced medical care as soon as signs and symptoms of a heart attack are noted. If you think that someone might be having a heart attack, you should:  QCall 9-1-1 or the designated emergency number immediately. Never try to drive a person who is  experiencing signs and symptoms of a heart attack to the hospital yourself. EMS personnel can transport the person to the hospital safely while initiating care.  QHave the person stop what they are doing and rest in a comfortable position to reduce the heart’s need  for oxygen. Many people experiencing a heart attack find it easier to breathe while sitting (Figure 6-3).  QLoosen any tight or uncomfortable clothing.  QReassure the person. Anxiety increases the person’s discomfort.MEN... WOMEN...

QIf the person is responsive, able to chew and swallow, and allowed to have aspirin, you may offer two   low-dose (81-mg) aspirin tablets or one 5-grain (325-mg) regular-strength aspirin tablet (Box 6-1).  QClosely monitor the person’s condition until EMS personnel arrive and take over. Notice any changes in  the person’s appearance or behavior.  QIf you are trained in giving CPR and using an automated external defibrillator (AED), be prepared to give  CPR and use an AED if the person becomes unresponsive. Angina Pectoris Some people with narrowed arteries may experience chest pain or pressure that comes and goes at different times (i.e., intermittent chest pain or pressure). This type of pain is called angina pectoris,  which is a  medical term for pain in the chest. Angina pectoris, often referred to simply as angina, develops when the heart needs more oxygen than it is getting. When the coronary arteries are narrow and the heart needs more oxygen, such as during physical activity or emotional stress, heart muscle tissue may not get enough oxygen. This lack of oxygen can cause a constricting chest pain that may spread to the neck, jaw and arms. Pain associated with angina seldom lasts longer than 3 to 5 minutes. A person who knows that they have a history of angina may tell you they have a prescribed medication,  such as nitroglycerin, that will temporarily widen (i.e., vasodilate) the arteries and therefore help relieve the pain. Nitroglycerin  is commonly prescribed as a small tablet that dissolves under the tongue or as an oral  spray. Sometimes nitroglycerin patches or paste are placed on the chest and the medication is absorbed transdermally (i.e., through the skin) into the bloodstream. Once absorbed into the body, nitroglycerin dilates the blood vessels to make it easier for blood to reach heart muscle tissue, thus relieving the chest pain. Figure 6-3.  Tell a person with signs and symptoms of a heart attack to stop and rest. Many people find breathing easier  while sitting.'\n",
            " 'Cardiac EmergenciesMost people with angina pectoris are advised by their doctors to take three nitroglycerin doses over a 10-minute  period if they are experiencing pain or discomfort; however, it is important to remember that some doctors may prescribe nitroglycerin differently. Since these areas of narrowing can be the focus for clot formation and heart attack, if a person’s typical pain of angina lasts longer than usual, 9-1-1 or the designated emergency number should be called. It may be that the angina has progressed to a heart attack. Cardiac Arrest Cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack. Remember, a heart attack occurs when blood flow to part of the heart muscle is blocked, causing part of the heart muscle to die. Cardiac  arrest,  on the other hand, occurs when the heart stops beating  or beats too ineffectively to circulate blood to the brain and other vital organs. A network of special cells in the heart muscle conducts electrical impulses that coordinate contraction, causing the heart to beat rhythmically. In cardiac arrest, the electrical impulses become abnormal and chaotic or may even become absent. This causes the heart to lose the ability to beat rhythmically, or to stop beating altogether (Figure 6-4). Cardiovascular disease and certain congenital heart conditions  (conditions that a person is born with) can increase a person’s risk for cardiac arrest. Breathing emergencies, such as choking or drowning, can also lead to cardiac arrest because if the body’s supply of oxygen is interrupted, the heart soon stops beating. Every organ in Box 6-1.  Aspirin for a Heart Attack You may be able to help a person who is showing early signs and symptoms of a heart attack by offering  the person an appropriate dose of aspirin. Aspirin can help to prevent blood clotting and is most effective when given soon after the onset of signs and symptoms of a heart attack. However, you should never delay calling 9-1-1 or the designated emergency number to find or offer aspirin. Before offering aspirin, make sure the person is responsive, able to chew and  swallow, and allowed to have aspirin. Ask the person:  QAre you allergic to aspirin?  QDo you have a stomach ulcer or stomach disease?  QAre you taking any blood thinners, such as warfarin (Coumadin™)?  QHave you ever been told by a healthcare provider to avoid taking aspirin? If the person answers “no” to each of these questions, you  may offer the person two low-dose (81-mg) aspirin tablets or one 5-grain (325-mg) regular-strength aspirin tablet. Have the person chew the aspirin completely. Chewing the aspirin speeds its absorption into the bloodstream. Do not offer the person an aspirin-containing combination product meant to relieve multiple conditions, or another type of pain medication, such as acetaminophen (T ylenol ®), ibuprofen (Motrin®, Advil®) or naproxen (Aleve®). These medications do not  work the same way aspirin does and are not beneficial for a person who is experiencing a heart attack. Figure 6-4.  Cardiac arrest occurs when the  electrical impulses that control the heartbeat become abnormal and chaotic or even absent.'\n",
            " 'Cardiac Emergenciesthe body needs a steady supply of oxygen in order  to work properly, and the heart is no exception. Severe trauma, electric shock and drug overdose are other potential causes of cardiac arrest. Although cardiac arrest is more common in adults, it does occur in young people as well. The most common causes of cardiac arrest in children and infants are breathing emergencies, congenital heart disorders and trauma. When the heart stops beating properly, the body  cannot survive for long. Breathing will soon stop, and the body’s organs will no longer receive the oxygen they need to function. Without oxygen, brain damage can begin in about 4 to 6 minutes, and the damage can become irreversible after about 8 to 10 minutes (Figure 6-5). Death occurs within a matter of minutes if the person does not receive immediate care. Signs and Symptoms of Cardiac Arrest When a person experiences cardiac arrest, you may see the person suddenly collapse. When you check the person, you will find that the person is not responsive and not breathing, or only gasping. (In an unresponsive person, isolated or infrequent gasping in the absence of normal breathing may be agonal breaths,  which  can occur even after the heart has stopped beating. Agonal breaths are not breathing and are a sign of cardiac arrest.) The person has no heartbeat. Cardiac arrest can happen suddenly and without any warning signs. When this occurs, the person is said  to have experienced sudden cardiac arrest.  People who have a history of cardiovascular disease or a  congenital heart disorder are at higher risk for sudden cardiac arrest. However, sudden cardiac arrest can happen in people who appear healthy and have no known heart disease or other risk factors for the condition. A person who experiences sudden cardiac arrest is at very high risk for dying and needs immediate care. First Aid Care for Cardiac Arrest When a person experiences cardiac arrest, quick action on the part of those who witness the arrest is crucial and gives the person the greatest chance for survival. The Cardiac Chain of Survival  describes five actions  that, when performed in rapid succession, increase the person’s likelihood of surviving cardiac arrest (Box 6-2). In the Cardiac Chain of Survival, each link of the chain depends on, and is connected to, the other links. Four out of every five cardiac arrests in the United States occur outside of the hospital. That means trained lay  responders like you are often responsible for initiating the Cardiac Chain of Survival. When you complete the first three links in the Cardiac Chain of Survival—recognizing cardiac arrest and activating the EMS system, immediately beginning CPR and using an AED as soon as possible—you give the person the best chance for surviving the incident. For each minute that CPR and use of an AED are delayed, the person’s chance for survival is  reduced by about 10 percent. If you think that a person is in cardiac arrest:  QHave someone call 9-1-1 or the designated emergency number immediately.  QBegin CPR immediately.

            " 'Cardiac EmergenciesCPR CPR,  or cardiopulmonary resuscitation,  is   a skill that is used when a person is in cardiac  arrest to keep oxygenated blood moving to the  brain and other vital organs until advanced medical  help arrives (Figure 6-6). CPR involves giving sets  of 30 chest compressions followed by sets of  2 rescue breaths. When you give compressions, you press down on the person’s chest. This squeezes (compresses) the heart between the breastbone (sternum) and spine, moving blood out of the heart and to the brain and other vital organs. After each compression, you must let the chest return to its normal position. This allows blood to flow back into the heart. The rescue breaths you give after each set of 30 compressions deliver a fresh supply of oxygen into the person’s lungs. When you give CPR, you help to keep oxygenated blood moving throughout the body, which can buy the person some time until advanced medical help arrives. Although full CPR (compressions and rescue breaths) is preferred, if you are unable or unwilling for any  reason to give full CPR, you can give compression-only CPR  instead. In compression-only CPR, you give  continuous chest compressions, with no rescue breaths. After checking the scene and the person and calling 9-1-1 or the designated emergency number, give chest compressions without stopping until another trained responder or EMS personnel take over or you notice an obvious sign of life. Many lay responders worry about hurting the person (for example, by breaking the person’s ribs or breastbone) while giving CPR, but a person who is in need of CPR is clinically dead (i.e., the person has no heartbeat and is not breathing). It is very unlikely that you will injure the person while giving CPR, but even if you do, consider this: any injury you may cause is secondary when compared with the person’s current circumstances, and the injury will heal with medical care and time. Remember: the worst thing to do is nothing! AED While CPR can help to prevent brain damage and death by keeping oxygenated blood moving throughout the body, an AED can correct the underlying problem for some people who go into sudden cardiac arrest. Two abnormal heart rhythms in particular, ventricular fibrillation (V-fib)  and ventricular tachycardia  (V-tach),  can lead to sudden cardiac arrest. Both abnormal rhythms impair the heart’s ability to pump and  circulate blood throughout the body and are life threatening (for more information, see When the Heart Fails later in this chapter). However, in many cases, V-fib and V-tach can be corrected by an electrical shock delivered by an AED. This shock disrupts the heart’s electrical activity long enough to allow the heart to spontaneously develop an effective rhythm on its own. Starting CPR immediately and using an AED as  soon as possible gives the person the best chance for surviving cardiac arrest (Figure 6-7). Figure 6-6.  CPR keeps oxygen-containing blood circulating  to the brain and other vital organs.'\n",
            " 'Cardiac EmergenciesCaring for Cardiac Arrest If you check a person and find that they are unresponsive and not breathing or only gasping, begin CPR  immediately, starting with chest compressions. Proper technique is important. Skill sheets 6-1, 6-2 and 6-3 describe step by step how to give CPR to an adult, child and infant, respectively. Table 6-1 summarizes the key differences in giving CPR to an adult, child or infant. See also Smart Moves: Improving CPR Techniques. Giving CPR to an Adult First, make sure the person is lying face-up on a firm, flat surface. For example, if the person is on a soft surface like a sofa or bed, quickly move them to the floor before you begin. Kneel beside the person.  QPosition your hands.  Place the heel of one hand  in the center of the person’s chest on the person’s breastbone (sternum). If you feel the notch at the end of the breastbone, move your hand slightly toward the person’s head. Place your other hand on top of your first hand and interlace your fingers or hold them up so that your fingers are not on the person’s chest. If you have arthritis in your hands, you can grasp the wrist of the hand positioned on the chest with your other hand instead. The person’s clothing should not interfere with finding the proper hand position or your ability to give effective compressions. If it does, loosen or remove enough clothing to allow deep compressions in the center of the person’s chest.  QGive a set of 30 compressions.  Position your  body so that your shoulders are directly over your hands. This will let you push on the chest using a straight down-and-up motion, which moves the most blood with each push and is also less tiring. Keeping  Figure 6-7.

You want to go at a rate of between 100 and 120 compressions per minute. As you give compressions, count out loud up to 30. Maintain a smooth, steady down-and-up rhythm and do not pause between compressions.  QGive a set of 2 rescue breaths.  Once you have given 30 compressions, give 2 rescue breaths. First,  open the airway using the head-tilt/chin-lift maneuver.  Place one of your hands on the person’s  forehead and two fingers of your other hand on the bony part of the person’s chin. Tilt the person’s head back and lift the chin. For an adult, tilt the head to a past-neutral position (see Table 6-1). If possible, use a CPR breathing barrier when you are giving rescue breaths, but do not delay rescue breaths to find a breathing barrier or learn how to use it. Pinch the person’s nose shut. Take a normal breath, make a complete seal over the person’s mouth with your mouth, and blow into the person’s mouth to give the first rescue breath. Take another breath, make a seal and give the second rescue breath. Each rescue breath should last about 1 second and make the person’s chest rise. After you finish giving 2 rescue breaths, return to giving compressions as quickly as possible. The process of giving 2 rescue breaths and getting back to compressions should take less than 10 seconds. Never give more than 2 rescue breaths per set. Table 6-2 describes how to troubleshoot special situations when giving rescue breaths. Once you begin CPR, continue giving sets of 30 chest compressions and 2 rescue breaths until:  QYou notice an obvious sign of life, such as movement. (If the person shows an obvious sign of life, stop  CPR, place the person in the recovery position and continue to monitor the person’s condition until EMS personnel take over.)  QAn AED is ready to use and no other trained responders are available to assist you with the AED. SMART MOVES  IMPROVING CPR TECHNIQUES Counting out loud as you give compressions can help you to keep a steady, even rhythm. For compressions 1 through 12, say “1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 and…” up to 12. When you get to 13, just say the number: “1 3, 14, 15, 1 6…” up to 30. Push down as you say the number and come up as you say “and” (or the second syllable of the number). This will help you to keep a steady, even rhythm. Incorrect technique or body position can cause your arms and shoulders to tire quickly when you are  giving compressions. Use the weight of your upper body, not your arm muscles, to compress the chest. Avoid rocking back and forth, because rocking makes your compressions less e ffective and wastes your energy. Also avoid leaning on the chest, because leaning prevents the chest from returning to its normal position after each compression, limiting the amount of blood that can return to the heart . When giving rescue breaths, keep the person’s head tilted back and avoid taking too large o f a breath or blowing too forcefully. Failing to keep the person’s head tilted back, taking too large of a breath or blowing too forcefully can force air into the person’s stomach instead of into their lungs, which can make the person vomit and cause other complications. Remember: Keep the head tilted back, take a normal breath and blow just enough to make the chest rise.'\n",
            " 'Cardiac EmergenciesTable 6-2.  Special Situations: Rescue Breathing Special Situation Solution The breaths do not make the chest rise.   Never give more than 2 rescue breaths per set. If  the first rescue breath does not cause the chest to rise, retilt the head to ensure that the airway is properly opened and ensure that the person’s nose and mouth are properly sealed before giving the second rescue breath. If the second breath does not make the chest rise, an object may be blocking the person’s airway. Give CPR with one modification: after each set of compressions and before giving rescue breaths, open the mouth, look for an object in the person’s mouth and, if you see it, remove it. The person vomits or there is fluid in the mouth.   Roll the person onto their side and clear the mouth  of fluid using a gloved finger or a piece of gauze. Then roll the person onto their back and resume giving care. You are unable to form a tight seal over the  person’s mouth (e.g., due to an injury). Use mouth-to-nose breathing instead. With the person’s head tilted back, close the person’s mouth by pushing on the person’s chin. Make a complete seal over the person’s nose with your mouth and blow in for 1 second to make the chest rise. (Continued )'\n",
            " 'Cardiac EmergenciesWhat if…  I am giving chest compressions to a person in cardiac arrest and I hear a rib crack? In the adult population, particularly among older adults, rib and sternal (breastbone) fractures can be   a complication of CPR. Making sure you use proper hand placement can minimize this risk. If you do  hear a cracking sound and begin to feel crepitus (grinding) while compressing the chest, reassess  your hand position and correct it as needed. Try to also remember that the potential benefits of  CPR—namely, saving a life—outweigh the unpleasantness of a broken rib, which in most cases is not  a life-threatening injury. What if…  During CPR I lose count of the number of chest compressions I am performing and do more  or less than the recommended 30 compressions? While 30 compressions is the recommended amount, performing 28 chest compressions in one cycle  and 32 chest compressions in another cycle is not going to hurt the person’s chances of survival. Rather, what is important are the chest compression rate and depth, which, for an adult, should be between 100 and 120 compressions per minute and at least 2 inches deep, while minimizing any interruptions. Giving CPR to a Child Giving CPR to a child is very similar to giving CPR to an adult. However, in a child, you open the airway by tilting the head to a slightly past-neutral position, rather than to a past-neutral position (see Table 6-1). Rather than compressing the chest to a depth of at least  2 inches as you would for an adult, you compress the chest  to a depth of about  2 inches for a child. Also, for a small child you may only need to give compressions with  one hand, instead of two. The rate of chest compressions for a child is the same as it is for an adult—between 100 and 120 compressions per minute.Special Situation Solution The person has a tracheostomy  or “stoma, ” a  surgically created opening in the front of the neck that opens into the trachea (windpipe) to form an alternate route for breathing when the upper airway is blocked or damaged.Use mouth-to-stoma breathing instead. Expose the  person’s neck down to the breastbone and remove anything covering the stoma (e.g., a filter or stoma cover). Wipe away any secretions from the stoma. Make a complete seal over the person’s stoma or tracheostomy tube with your mouth and blow in for 1 second to make the chest rise.   QIf the chest does not rise, the tracheostomy  tube may be blocked. Remove the inner tube and try rescue breaths again.   QIf you hear or feel air escaping from the  person’s mouth or nose, the person is a partial neck breather (i.e., there is still a connection between the trachea and the upper airway, and although the person breathes mainly through the stoma, they are also able to breathe to some extent through the mouth and nose). Seal the person’s mouth and nose with your hand or a tight-fitting mask so that air does not escape out of the mouth or nose when you give rescue breaths into the stoma.Table 6-2. continued'\n",
            " 'Cardiac EmergenciesGiving CPR to an Infant The general principles of giving CPR to an infant are the same as they are for children and adults. However,  because the infant’s body is smaller, you will position your hands differently to deliver compressions. Place the pads of two fingers on the center of the infant’s chest, just below the nipple line. If you feel the notch at the end of the infant’s breastbone, move your fingers slightly toward the infant’s head. Place your other hand on  the infant’s forehead. Give compressions by using the pads of your fingers to compress the chest about  1½ inches at the same rate as you would for an adult or a child—between 100 and 120 compressions per minute. When you give rescue breaths, open the airway by tilting the head to a neutral position (see Table 6-1).  Instead of pinching the nose shut and covering the mouth with your mouth, cover the infant’s nose and mouth with your mouth to form a seal. When to Stop CPR Once you begin CPR on an adult, child or infant, do not stop except in one of these situations:  QYou notice an obvious sign of life, such as normal breathing.  QAn AED becomes available and is ready to use.  QAnother trained responder or EMS personnel arrive and take over.  QYou are too exhausted to continue.  QThe scene becomes unsafe. If at any time the adult, child or infant begins to breathe normally or show another sign of life, stop CPR, place  the person in the recovery position (see Chapter 5) and closely monitor breathing and any changes in the person’s condition until EMS personnel take over. The Heart’s Electrical System The heart’s electrical system controls its pumping action. In normal conditions, specialized cells of the heart initiate and transmit electrical impulses. These cells make up the conduction system. Electrical impulses travel through the upper chambers of the heart, called the atria, to the lower chambers of the heart, called the ventricles (Figure 6-8). The normal point of origin of the electrical impulse is the  sinoatrial (SA) node above the atria. This impulse travels to a point midway between the atria and ventricles called the atrioventricular (AV) node. The pathway divides after the AV node into two branches, the right and left ventricles. These right and left branches become a network of fibers, called Purkinje fibers, which spread electrical impulses across the heart. Under normal conditions, this impulse reaches the muscular walls of the ventricles and causes the ventricles to contract. This contraction forces blood out of the heart to circulate through the body. The contraction of the left ventricle results in a pulse. The pauses between the pulse beats are the periods between contractions. When the heart muscles relax, blood refills the chambers. Electrical activity of the heart can be evaluated with a cardiac monitor or electrocardiograph. Electrodes  attached to an electrocardiograph pick up electrical impulses and transmit them to a monitor. This graphic record is referred to as an electrocardiogram (EKG). Heart rhythms appear on an EKG as a series of peaks and valleys. SA node AV nodeAtria Ventricles Purkinje fibers Figure 6-8.  The heart’s electrical system.'\n",
            " 'Cardiac EmergenciesWhen the Heart Fails Any damage to the heart from disease or injury can disrupt the heart’s electrical system. This disruption can  result in an abnormal heart rhythm that can stop circulation. The two most common abnormal rhythms leading to cardiac arrest are ventricular fibrillation (V-fib) and ventricular tachycardia (V-tach). V-fib is a state of totally disorganized electrical activity in the heart. It results in fibrillation, or quivering, of  the ventricles. In V-fib, the electrical impulses fire at random, creating chaos and preventing the heart from pumping and circulating blood. A person with V-fib will suddenly collapse and stop breathing normally (occasional gasping breaths, or agonal breathing, may be observed for a period of time, but these gasps are not normal breathing). V-tach refers to a very rapid contraction of the ventricles. Although there is electrical activity resulting in a  regular rhythm, the rate is often so fast that the heart is unable to pump blood properly. As with V-fib, the person with V-tach may collapse, become unresponsive and stop breathing normally. Defibrillation In many cases, V-fib and V-tach rhythms can be corrected by early defibrillation. Delivering an electrical shock with an AED disrupts the electrical activity of V-fib and V-tach long enough to allow the heart to spontaneously develop an effective rhythm on its own. If V-fib or V-tach is not interrupted, all electrical activity will eventually cease, a condition called asystole.  Asystole cannot be corrected by defibrillation. Remember  that you cannot tell what rhythm, if any, the heart has by checking for signs of life. CPR, started immediately and continued until defibrillation, helps maintain a low level of circulation in the body until the abnormal rhythm can be corrected by defibrillation. The Amazing Heart Too often, we take our hearts for granted. The heart beats about 70 times each minute or more than 100,000 times a day. During an average lifetime, the heart will beat nearly 3 billion times. The heart circulates about a gallon of blood per minute or about 40 million gallons in an average lifetime. The  heart circulates blood through about 60,000 miles of blood vessels. What if…  I accidentally deliver an unnecessary shock while using an AED? An AED is designed to allow the responder to deliver a shock only when the AED has detected  the presence of a life-threatening arrhythmia (e.g., V-fib or V-tach). If the device does not detect a shockable rhythm, it will instruct you to perform CPR. Using an AED Different types of AEDs are available, but all are similar to operate and use visual displays, voice prompts or both to guide the responder. If your place of employment has an AED on site, know where it is located, how to operate it and how to maintain it (Box 6-3). Also take note of the location of AEDs in public places that you frequent, such as shopping centers, airports, recreation centers and sports arenas. When a person is in cardiac arrest, use an AED as soon as  possible. Skill Sheet 6-4 describes how to use an AED step by step. Environmental and person-specific considerations for safe and effective AED use are given in Box 6-4.'\n",

QAfter using the AED, make sure that all  supplies are restocked and that the device is in proper working order.  QIf at any time the AED fails to work properly  or warning indicators illuminate, take the AED out of service and contact the manufacturer or the appropriate person at your place of employment, according to your employer’s policy. You may need to return the AED to the manufacturer for service. If the AED stops working during an emergency, continue giving CPR until EMS personnel take over. Box 6-4.  Considerations for Safe and Effective AED Use Environmental Considerations  QFlammable or combustible materials.   Do not use an AED around flammable or combustible materials, such as gasoline or free-flowing oxygen.  QMetal surfaces.  It is safe to use an AED  when the person is lying on a metal surface, as long as appropriate precautions are taken. Do not allow the AED pads to contact the metal surface, and ensure that no one is touching the person when the shock is delivered. QWater.  If the person is in water, remove them  from the water before using the AED. Once you have removed the person from the water, be sure there are no puddles of water around you, the person or the AED.  QInclement weather.  It is safe to use AEDs  in all weather conditions, including rain and snow. Provide a dry environment if possible (for example, by sheltering the person with umbrellas), but do not delay defibrillation to do so. Remove wet clothing and wipe the person’s chest dry before placing the AED pads. Avoid getting the AED or AED pads wet. (Continued )'\n",
            " 'Cardiac EmergenciesUsing an AED on an Adult To use an AED, first turn the device on. Remove or cut away  clothing and undergarments to expose the person’s chest. If the person’s chest is wet, dry it using a towel or gauze pad. Dry skin helps the AED pads to stick properly. Do not use an alcohol wipe to dry the skin because alcohol is flammable. Next, apply the AED pads. Peel the backing off the pads as directed, one at a time, to expose the adhesive. Place one pad on the upper right side of the person’s chest and the other pad on the lower left side of the person’s chest below the armpit, pressing firmly to adhere (Figure 6-9). Plug the connector cable into the AED (if necessary) and follow the device’s directions. Most AEDs will begin to analyze the heart rhythm automatically, but some may require you to push an “analyze” button to start this process. No one should touch the person while the AED is analyzing the heart rhythm because this could result in a faulty reading. Next, the AED will tell you to push the “shock” button if a shock  is advised. Again, avoid touching the person, because anyone who is touching the person while the device is delivering a  Figure 6-9.  Place one AED pad on the upper right  side of the chest and the other on the lower left side of the chest, below the armpit.Person-Specific Consideration s QPregnancy . It is safe to use an AED on a  woman w ho is pregnant . QPacemakers and im plantable  cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) . A  person who has a known arrhythmia (irregularheartbeat ) may have a pacemaker or an ICD.  These are sma ll devices t hat are surgica lly implanted under the skin to automatica lly prevent or correct an irregu lar heartbeat. You may be able to see or feel the outline  of the pacemaker or ICD in the area below the person’s collarbone, or the person may wear a medical identification ta g indicatin g that they have a pacemaker or I CD. If the implanted device is visi ble or you know t hat  the person has a pacemaker or I CD, ad just pad placement as necessary to avoid placing the AED pads directly over the device because doing so may interfere with the delivery of the shock. However, if you are not sure whether the  person has an im planted device, place the  pads as you normally would . QTransdermal medication patches . Some ty pes of medications, including nitroglycerin (used to relieve chest paincaused b y cardiovascular disease) and smoking-cessation me dications, are delivered through  patches a pplied to the skin. Remove any me dication patc hes that you see before applying AED pads and using  an AED. Wear disposable latex-free gloves to prevent absorption of the drug throughyour own s kin. QChest hair . Time is critica l in a car diac  arrest situation, an d chest hair rare ly  inter feres with pad adhesion, so in most cases you should proceed as you normally  would—attach the AED pads, pressing firmly to attach them. However, i f the person has  a great deal of thick chest hair and it seems like the chest hair could interfere with pad- to-skin contact, quickly shave the areas  where the pads will be placed and then  attach the pads. QJewelry and body piercin gs. You do not  need to remove t he person ’s jewe lry or body piercings before using an AED, but you should  avoid placing the AED pads directly over any metallic jewelry or piercings. Ad just pad  placement if necessary .Box 6-4.  continued'\n",
            " 'Cardiac Emergenciesshock is at risk for receiving a shock as well. After a shock is delivered (or if the AED determines that no shock  is necessary), immediately resume CPR, starting with compressions. The AED will continue to check the heart rhythm every 2 minutes. Listen for prompts from the AED and continue giving CPR and using the AED until you notice an obvious sign of life or EMS personnel arrive. If you notice an obvious sign of life, stop CPR but leave the AED turned on and the pads in place on the person’s chest, and continue to follow the AED’s prompts. Using an AED on a Child or Infant The procedure for using an AED on a child or infant is the same as the procedure for using an AED on an adult. Some AEDs come with pediatric AED pads that are smaller and designed specifically to analyze a child’s heart rhythm and deliver a lower level of energy. These pads should be used on children up to 8 years of age or weighing less than 55 pounds. Other AEDs have a key or switch that configures the AED for use on a child up to 8 years of age or weighing less than 55 pounds. If pediatric AED pads are not available or the AED does not have a pediatric setting, it is safe to use adult AED pads and adult levels of energy on a child or infant. (Note that the opposite is not true—you should not use pediatric AED pads or the pediatric setting on an adult because the shock delivered will not be sufficient if the person is older than 8 years of age or weighs more than 55 pounds.) Just as when you are using an AED on an adult, apply the AED pads to the child’s bare, dry chest, placing  one pad on the upper right chest and the other pad on the lower left side of the chest below the armpit. If you cannot position the pads this way without them touching (as in the case of an infant or a small child), position one pad in the middle of the chest and the other pad on the back between the shoulder blades (Figure 6-10, A–B). Then follow the standard procedure for using an AED. Working as a Team Remember, when you are giving CPR, you want to give high-quality compressions at the appropriate depth and rate. You also want to minimize interruptions to chest compressions. If you are the only trained responder at the scene, you will begin to tire as you give CPR, and the quality of your compressions will diminish. You will also need to stop CPR to ready the AED for use when it arrives, which means that during that time, there is no oxygenated blood moving through the person’s body. Working as a team can lead to a better chance of survival for the person in cardiac arrest, by reducing  responder fatigue and minimizing interruptions to chest compressions. Trained responders can share the responsibility for giving compressions, switching off every 2 minutes, which reduces fatigue and leads to better-quality compressions. Having two or more trained responders at the scene also minimizes interruptions to chest compressions when the AED arrives.Figure 6-10, A–B.  If the person is too small to place both AED pads on the  front of the chest without the pads touching, place one on the middle of the chest, A, and the other on the back between the shoulder blades,  B. AB'\n",
            " 'Cardiac EmergenciesWhen two or more responders trained in CPR and using an AED are at the scene, all should identify themselves  as being trained. The first responder should begin CPR while the second responder calls 9-1-1 or the designated emergency number, obtains the AED and readies the AED for use by turning the device on, applying the pads to the person’s chest and plugging in the connector cable, if necessary (Figure 6-11). The first responder should not pause CPR until the device is ready to analyze the person’s heart rhythm and the second responder tells everyone to stand clear. While the AED is analyzing, the responders should switch roles so that the second responder can take over giving chest compressions. The responder who is taking over compressions should hover with their hands positioned just above the person’s chest so that they can immediately start compressions as soon as the AED prompts that a shock was delivered or that no shock was advised. The responders then switch roles every time the AED analyzes the person’s heart rhythm, which occurs every 2 minutes. Summary Cardiac emergencies present a major health threat to our communities. Heart attack and cardiac arrest are the two common cardiac emergencies. Learning to recognize the signs and symptoms of a heart attack and responding immediately can reduce the risk of complications and help prevent cardiac arrest. If a person experiences cardiac arrest, the greatest chance of survival occurs when the Cardiac Chain of Survival happens as rapidly as possible. By learning to recognize the signs and symptoms of cardiac emergencies and how to give care, you can make a difference. Figure 6-11.  Working as a team can lead to a better chance of survival for the person in cardiac arrest. READY TO RESPOND?

            " 'INTRODUCTION  TO GREEN TABLES TABLE 1 - INITIAL ISOLATION AND PROTECTIVE ACTION DISTANCES This table suggests distances useful to protect people from vapors/gases resulting from  spills involving:  materials that are considered toxic by inhalation (TIH) (PIH in the US)  materials that produce toxic gases upon contact with water  chemical warfare agents This table provides first responders with initial guidance until technically qualified emergency  response personnel are available . For each material, first responders will find distances for  the following zones:  The Initial Isolation Zone defines an area surrounding the incident in which  people may be exposed to dangerous (upwind) and life-threatening (downwind)  concentrations of material .  The Protective Action Zone defines an area downwind from the incident in which  people may become incapacitated and unable to take protective action and/or incur  serious or irreversible health effects . Table 1 provides specific guidance for small and  large spills occurring day or night . Adjusting distances for a specific incident involves many interdependent variables . These  adjustments should only be made by technically qualified personnel . For this reason, no  precise guidance can be provided in this document to aid in adjusting the table distances;  however, general guidance follows . Factors that May Change the Protective Action Distances Fire In the orange-bordered pages, under EVACUATION – Fire, the evacuation distance required  to protect against fragmentation hazard of a large container is clearly indicated . If involved in  a fire, the toxic hazard may be less dangerous than the fire or explosion hazard . In these cases, the fire hazard distance should be used as an isolation distance and Table  1 should be used to protect downwind for residual material release . Worst-case scenario: terrorism, sabotage or catastrophic accident Initial isolation and protective action distances are derived from historical data on  transportation incidents and the use of statistical models . For worst-case scenarios involving  the instantaneous release of the entire contents of a package (e .g ., as a result of terrorism,  sabotage or catastrophic accident), the distances may increase substantially . For such events, doubling the initial isolation and protective action distances is appropriate  in absence of other information . When more than one large package is leaking If more than one rail car, tank truck, tank or large cylinder, containing TIH materials is leaking,  large spill  distances may need to be increased .'\n",
            " 'Other factors that can increase the protective action distance:  If a material has a protective action distance of 11.0+ km (7.0+ miles), the actual  distance can be larger in certain atmospheric conditions .  If the material’s vapor plume is channeled in a valley  or between many tall  buildings , protective action distances may be larger than shown due to less mixing  of the plume with the atmosphere .  If there is a daytime spill in a region with known strong temperature inversions  or snow cover, or it occurs near sunset, this may require an increase of the  protective action distance because airborne contaminants mix and disperse more  slowly and may travel much farther downwind .  ›In such cases, the nighttime protective action distances may be more  appropriate .  If the temperature of the liquid spill or the outdoor temperature exceeds 30°C  (86°F), the protective action distance may be larger . Water-reactive materials Materials that react with water to produce large amounts of toxic gases are included in Table  1 . Some of these materials have 2 entries in Table 1 . They are identified by (when spilled  on land) since they are TIH products and (when spilled in water) because they produce  additional toxic gases when spilled in water .  Choose the larger protective action distance  if:  it is not clear whether the spill is on land or in water  the spill occurs both on land and in water TABLE 2 - WATER-REACTIVE MATERIALS WHICH PRODUCE TOXIC GASES This table lists materials that produce large amounts of Toxic Inhalation Hazard gases (TIH)  when spilled in water as well as the TIH gases that are produced . NOTE: The produced TIH gases indicated in Table 2 are for information purposes only  . In Table  1, the initial isolation and protective action distances have already taken into consideration  the produced TIH gas . When a water-reactive TIH-producing material is spilled into a river or stream, the source of  the toxic gas may flow downstream for a great distance . TABLE 3 - INITIAL ISOLATION AND PROTECTIVE ACTION DISTANCES FOR LARGE  SPILLS FOR DIFFERENT QUANTITIES OF SIX COMMON TIH (PIH IN THE US) GASES This table lists materials that may be more commonly encountered . These materials are:  UN1005 - Ammonia, anhydrous  UN1017 - Chlorine  UN1040 - Ethylene oxide and UN1040 - Ethylene oxide with nitrogen'\n",
            " 'UN1050 - Hydrogen chloride, anhydrous and UN2186 - Hydrogen chloride,  refrigerated liquid  UN1052 - Hydrogen fluoride, anhydrous  UN1079 - Sulfur dioxide/Sulphur dioxide This table provides initial isolation and protective action distances for large spills (more than  208 liters or 55 US gallons):  involving different container types (therefore different volume capacities)  for daytime and nighttime situations  for different wind speeds (low, moderate and high)'\n",
            " 'PROTECTIVE ACTIONS Protective actions are the steps taken to preserve the health and safety of emergency  responders and the public during an incident involving releases of hazardous materials/ dangerous goods . Table 1 - Initial Isolation and Protective Action Distances (green-bordered pages) predicts  the size of the area that could be affected by a cloud of toxic gas . People in this area should  be evacuated and/or sheltered-in-place inside buildings . Isolate hazard area and deny entry means to keep everybody away from the area if they are  not directly involved in emergency response operations . Unprotected emergency responders  should not be allowed to enter the isolation zone . This \"isolation\" task is done to establish control over the area of operations . This is the first  step for any protective actions that may follow . Evacuate means to move all people from a threatened area to a safer place . To perform an  evacuation, there must be enough time for people to be warned, get ready, and leave an  area . If there is enough time, evacuation is the best protective action . Begin evacuating people nearby and those who are outdoors in direct view of the scene .  When additional help arrives, expand the area to be evacuated downwind and crosswind to  at least the extent recommended in this guidebook . Even after people move to the distances recommended, they may not be completely safe  from harm . They should not be permitted to gather at such distances . Send evacuees to a  definite place, by a specific route, far enough away so they will not have to be moved again  if the wind shifts . Shelter-in-place means people should seek shelter inside a building and remain inside  until the danger passes . It is vital for first responders to maintain communications with  sheltered-in-place people so that they are advised about changing conditions .  Sheltering-in-place is used either when:  evacuating the public would cause greater risk than staying where they are  an evacuation cannot be performed Direct the people inside to:  close all doors and windows  shut off all ventilating, heating and cooling systems  stay far from windows to avoid shattered glass and projectile metal fragments in  the event of a fire and/or explosion  tune in to local radio or TV stations, and stay inside until told it is safe to leave by  first responders Shelter-in-place may not be the best option if:  the vapors are flammable'\n",
            " 'it will take a long time for the gas to clear the area  buildings cannot be closed tightly Vehicles can offer some protection for a short period if the windows are closed and the  ventilation systems are shut off . Vehicles are not as effective as buildings for in-place protection . NOTE:  Every hazardous materials/dangerous goods incident is different . Each will have special  problems and concerns . Actions to protect the public must be carefully selected . These pages  can help with initial decisions on how to protect the public . Officials must continue to gather  information and monitor the situation until the threat is removed .'\n",
            " 'PROTECTIVE ACTION DECISION FACTORS TO CONSIDER The choice of protective actions for a given situation depends on a number of factors . For  some cases, evacuation may be the best option; in others, sheltering-in-place may be the  best course . Sometimes, these two actions may be used in combination . In any emergency,  officials need to quickly give the public instructions . The public will need continuing information  and instructions while being evacuated or sheltered-in-place . Proper evaluation of the factors listed below will determine the effectiveness of evacuation or  in-place protection (shelter-in-place) . The importance of these factors can vary with emergency  conditions . In specific emergencies, other factors may need to be identified and considered as  well .

            " 'BACKGROUND ON TABLE 1 – INITIAL ISOLATION   AND PROTECTIVE ACTION DISTANCES Initial isolation and protective action distances in this guidebook were determined for small  and large spills occurring during day or night . The overall analysis, statistical in nature, was  conducted using:  state-of-the-art emission rate and dispersion models  statistical release data from the U .S . Department of Transportation (DOT) Hazardous  Materials Information System (HMIS) database  meteorological observations from more than 120 locations in the United States,  Canada, and Mexico  the most current toxicological exposure guidelines For each chemical, thousands of hypothetical releases were modeled to account for the statistical  variance in both release amount and atmospheric conditions . Based on this statistical sample,  they selected the 90th percentile protective action distance for each chemical and category to  appear in the table . A brief description of the analysis is provided below . A detailed report outlining the methodology and data used to generate the initial isolation  and protective action distances may be obtained from the U .S  . DOT, Pipeline and Hazardous  Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) . DESCRIPTION OF THE ANALYSIS Release amounts and emission rates into the atmosphere were statistically modeled  based on:  data from the U .S . DOT HMIS database  container types and sizes authorized for transport as specified in 49 CFR §172 .101  and Part 173  physical properties of the individual materials  atmospheric data from a historical database For liquefied gases, which can flash to form both a vapor/aerosol mixture and an evaporating  pool, the emission model calculated one or both of:  the release of vapor due to evaporation of pools on the ground  direct release of vapors from the container  The emission model also calculated the emission of toxic vapor by-products generated from  spilling water-reactive materials in water . Small spills  involve 208 liters (55 US gallons) or less .  Large spills  involve greater quantities .'\n",
            " 'The exceptions are the entries at the beginning of Table 1 marked (when used as a weapon) .  The volumes used for these calculations varies, but in most cases:  Small spills include releases up to 2 kg (4 .4 lbs .) .  Large spills include releases up to 25 kg (55 lbs .) . Downwind dispersion of the vapor was estimated for each case modeled . Using a database  containing hourly meteorological data from 120 American, Canadian, and Mexican cities,  the atmospheric parameters affecting the dispersion and the emission rate were selected . The dispersion calculation accounted for both the:  time-dependent emission rate from the source  density of the vapor plume (i .e ., heavy gas effects) Since atmospheric mixing is less effective at dispersing vapor plumes during nighttime, day  and night were separated in the analysis . In the table:  day refers to time periods after sunrise and before sunset  night includes all hours between sunset and sunrise Toxicological short-term exposure guidelines for the materials were applied to determine  the downwind distance to which people may:  become incapacitated and unable to take protective action  incur serious health effects after a single, or rare, exposure When available, toxicological exposure guidelines were chosen from AEGL-2 or ERPG-2  emergency response guidelines . AEGL-2 values were the first choice . For materials without AEGL-2 or ERPG-2 values, emergency response guidelines were  estimated based on lethal concentration limits derived from animal-based-studies . This  approach was recommended by an independent panel of toxicological experts from industry  and academia .'\n",
            " 'HOW TO USE TABLE 1 – INITIAL ISOLATION AND   PROTECTIVE ACTION DISTANCES (1) The responder should already have:  identified the material by its ID number and name (if you cannot find an ID number,  use the Name of Material index in the blue-bordered pages to find that number);  confirmed that the material is highlighted in green in the yellow or blue-bordered  pages . If not, Table 1 doesn’t apply;  found the three-digit guide for the material, in order to consult emergency actions  it recommends along with this table; and  noted the wind direction (2) Look in Table 1 (green-bordered pages) for the ID number and name of the material  involved . Some ID numbers have more than one shipping name listed . Look for the  specific name of the material . If you do not know the shipping name and Table 1 lists  more than one name for the same ID number, use the entry with the largest distances . (3) Determine if the incident involves a SMALL or LARGE spill and if it is DAY or NIGHT . A  SMALL SPILL consists of a release of 208 liters (55 US gallons) or less . This generally  corresponds to a spill from a single small package (for example, a drum), a small cylinder,  or a small leak from a large package . A LARGE SPILL consists of a release of more than  208 liters (55 US gallons) . This usually involves a spill from a large package, or multiple  spills from many small packages . DAY is any time after sunrise and before sunset . NIGHT  is any time between sunset and sunrise .  (4) Look up the INITIAL ISOLATION DISTANCE .  This distance defines the radius of a zone (initial  isolation zone) surrounding the spill in ALL  DIRECTIONS . In this zone, protective clothing  and respiratory protection is required  . Evacuate  the general public in a direction perpendicular  to wind direction (crosswind) and away from  the spill . (5) Look up the PROTECTIVE ACTION DISTANCE .   For a given material, spill size, and whether day or night, Table 1 gives the downwind  distance—in kilometers and miles—from the spill or leak source, for which you should  consider protective actions . For practical purposes, the protective action zone (i .e ., the  area in which people are at risk of harmful exposure) is a square . Its length and width  are the same as the downwind distance shown in Table 1 . Protective actions are the Initial Isolation Distance SpillInitial Isolation Zone'\n",
            " 'steps you take to preserve the health and safety of emergency responders and the  public . People in this area should be evacuated and/or sheltered-in-place . Consult  pages 289-291 . (6) Initiate protective actions beginning with those closest to the spill site and working away  in a downwind direction . When a water-reactive TIH (PIH in the US) producing material  is spilled into a river or stream, the source of the toxic gas may move with the current  or stretch from the spill point downstream for a large distance . In the figure below, the spill is located at the center of the small black circle . The larger  circle represents the initial isolation zone around the spill . The square (the protective  action zone) is the area in which you should take protective actions . Note 1: For factors that may change the protective action distances, see \"Introduction  to Green Tables\" (page 286). Note 2: When a product in Table 1 has the mention (when spilled in water), you can  refer to Table 2 for the list of gases produced when these materials are spilled  in water. The TIH gases indicated in Table 2 are for information purposes only.

            " 'HOW TO USE TABLE 2 – WATER-REACTIVE MATERIALS THAT PRODUCE TOXIC GASES Table 2 lists materials that produce large amounts of Toxic Inhalation Hazard (TIH) (PIH in  the US) gases when spilled in water, and identifies the TIH gases produced . The materials are listed by order of ID number . These Water-Reactive materials are easily identified in Table 1 as their name is immediately  followed by (when spilled in water)  .  Note 1:  The TIH gases indicated in Table 2 are for information purposes only . In Table  1, the initial isolation and protective action distances have already taken into  consideration the TIH gases produced .  For example: Table 2 indicates that UN1689 sodium cyanide, when spilled  in water, will generate hydrogen cyanide gas (HCN) . In Table 1, you must  refer to the distances for sodium cyanide and not the distances for hydrogen  cyanide gas . Note 2: Some Water-Reactive materials are also TIH materials themselves (e .g ., UN1746  (Bromine trifluoride), UN1836 (Thionyl chloride)) . In these instances, two entries  are provided in Table 1 for land-based and water-based spills . If a water-reactive  material only has one entry in Table 1 for (when spilled in water), and the  product is NOT spilled in water, Tables 1 and 2 do NOT apply . Refer only to the  appropriate orange-bordered guide . Note 3: Materials classified as a Division 4 .3 are substances that, on contact with water,  are liable to become spontaneously FLAMMABLE or give off FLAMMABLE or  sometimes TOXIC gases in dangerous quantities . For the purpose of this table,  water-reactive materials are materials that generate substantial quantities of  TOXIC gases rapidly after a spill into water; therefore, a material classified as a  Division 4 .3 will not always be included in Table 2 .'\n",

Department of Transportation (DOT), and the Secretariat  of Communications and Transport of Mexico (SCT), with help from CIQUIME (Centro de  Información Química para Emergencias) of Argentina . This guidebook is for firefighters, police and other emergency services personnel who may  be first to arrive at the scene of a transportation incident involving dangerous goods . It is primarily a guide to help first responders to quickly:   identify the specific or generic hazards of material(s) involved in a transportation  incident  protect themselves and the general public during the initial response phase  of the incident For the purposes of this guidebook, “initial response phase” is the period after first responders  arrive at the scene of an incident . During this phase, responders:  confirm the presence and/or identification of dangerous goods  start taking protective action and securing the area  request the help of qualified personnel This guide is designed for use at a dangerous goods incident on a highway or railroad . It may  have limited value at fixed-facility locations, or onboard aircrafts or vessels . This guide does not:   provide information on the physical or chemical properties of dangerous goods  replace emergency response training, knowledge, or sound judgment  address all possible circumstances that may be associated with a dangerous goods  incident ERG2020 incorporates dangerous goods lists from the most recent United Nations  Recommendations, and from other international and national regulations . Explosives are not listed individually (by either proper shipping name or ID number) but,  under the general heading “Explosives”, they do appear:  on the first page of the ID Number index (yellow-bordered pages)  alphabetically in the Name of Material index (blue-bordered pages) Chemical warfare agents do not have an assigned ID number because they are not  commercially transported .

            " 'Each guide is divided into 3 main sections: :   Displays the hazards in terms of FIRE OR EXPLOSION and HEALTH effects upon  exposure .  Primary potential hazard is listed first .  Consult this section first to help you make decisions about how to protect the  emergency response team and surrounding population . PUBLIC SAFETY:   Provides general information on initial precautionary measures to be taken by those  first on scene .  Provides general guidance on PROTECTIVE CLOTHING requirements and respiratory  protection .  Lists suggested EVACUATION distances for immediate precautionary measures,  spills, and for fires (fragmentation hazard) .

            " 'Table 1 provides two types of recommended safety distances: “initial isolation distances”  and “protective action distances”  for:  small spills : 208 liters (55 US gallons) or less  large spills : more than 208 liters (55 US gallons)  Exception: For entries marked (when used as a weapon), volumes vary, but in most  cases, small spills include releases up to 2 kg (4 .4 lbs .), and large spills include  releases up to 25 kg (55 lbs .) . Within the “initial isolation distance”, protective clothing and respiratory protection is  required . You should consider evacuating all people in all directions from the spill or leak  source . This distance defines the radius of the “initial isolation zone” surrounding the spill in  which people may be exposed to:  dangerous concentrations upwind of the source  life-threatening concentrations downwind of the source The “protective action distances” are downwind distances from the spill or leak source,  within which responders could carry out protective actions to:  preserve the health and safety of emergency responders and the public  evacuate and/or shelter-in-place people in this area (For more information, consult  pp . 289 to 291) The “protective action distance” is divided into daytime and nighttime incidents because  varying atmospheric conditions affect a hazardous area’s size . In fact, the quantity or  concentration of the material’s vapor poses problems, not its mere presence . During the night,  the air is generally calmer . This causes the vapor to disperse less and therefore creates a  greater toxic zone . In daytime, the atmosphere is more active, so the vapor disperses more .  As a result, there is a lower concentration of vapor in the surrounding air and the area that  reaches toxic levels is smaller . Daytime is after sunrise and before sunset . Nighttime is  between sunset and sunrise . For example, in the case of a small spill of UN1955 - compressed gas, toxic, n .o .s ., the  “initial isolation distance” is 100 meters (300 feet); therefore its “initial isolation zone” is  200 meters (600 feet) in diameter . Its “protective action distance” is 0 .5 kilometers (0 .3  miles) for daytime and 2 .5 kilometers (1 .6 miles) for nighttime . Note 1: Some water-reactive materials have 2 entries in Table 1 . They are identified by (when  spilled on land) since they are TIH products and (when spilled in water) because they  produce additional toxic gases when spilled in water . For example: UN1746 - Bromine trifluoride and UN1836 - Thionyl chloride . Note 2: If a water-reactive material only has one entry in Table 1 for (when spilled in water)  and the product is NOT spilled in water, Table 1 and Table 2 do not apply . You will find safe  distances in the appropriate orange-bordered guide . For example: UN1183 - Ethyldichlorosilane and UN1898 – Acetyl iodide .'\n",
            " 'Table 2 - Water-Reactive Materials Which Produce Toxic Gases  Lists:  by order of ID number, materials that produce large amounts of Toxic Inhalation Hazard  (TIH) gases when spilled in water; and  TIH gases produced by these materials .  You can easily identify water-reactive materials in Table 1, as their names are immediately  followed by (when spilled in water). NOTE:  The TIH gases indicated in Table 2 are for information purposes only . These TIH gases  have already been taken into consideration in the distances of Table 1 . For example, Table 2 indicates that UN1689 sodium cyanide, when spilled in water, will  generate hydrogen cyanide gas (HCN) . In Table 1, you must refer to the distances for sodium  cyanide, solid and not the distances for hydrogen cyanide gas . Table 3 - Initial Isolation and Protective Action Distances for Large Spills for Different  Quantities of Six Common TIH Gases Lists the following 6 most common TIH materials:  UN1005 - Ammonia, anhydrous  UN1017 - Chlorine  UN1040 - Ethylene oxide and UN1040 - Ethylene oxide with nitrogen  UN1050 - Hydrogen chloride, anhydrous and UN2186 - Hydrogen chloride, refrigerated  liquid  UN1052 - Hydrogen fluoride, anhydrous  UN1079 - Sulfur dioxide/Sulphur dioxide Table 3 shows:   initial isolation and protective action distances for large spills (more than 208 liters  or 55 US gallons)  different container types (therefore different volume capacities) for daytime and  nighttime, and for three different wind speeds (low, moderate and high)'\n",

            " 'PROTECTIVE CLOTHING STREET CLOTHING AND WORK UNIFORMS These garments, such as uniforms worn by police and emergency medical services personnel,  provide almost no protection from the harmful effects of hazardous materials/dangerous goods . STRUCTURAL FIREFIGHTERS’ PROTECTIVE CLOTHING (SFPC) This category of clothing, often called turnout or bunker gear, is the protective clothing  firefighters normally wear during structural firefighting operations .  It includes a helmet, coat,  pants, boots, gloves and a hood to cover parts of the head that are not protected by the helmet  and facepiece . It can be used with full-facepiece positive pressure self-contained breathing  apparatus (SCBA) . It should, at minimum, meet the OSHA Fire Brigades Standard (29 CFR  1910 .156) or NFPA 1851 . Structural firefighters’ protective clothing provides limited protection from heat and cold . It may  not provide adequate protection from harmful vapors or liquids encountered during hazardous  materials/dangerous goods incidents .  Each guide includes a statement about the use of SFPC in incidents involving the materials  referenced by that guide . Some guides state that SFPC provides limited protection . In those  cases, the responder wearing SFPC and SCBA may be able to perform a quick “in-and-out”  operation . However, this type of operation can place the responder at risk of exposure, injury  or death . The incident commander makes the decision to do this only if there is an overriding  benefit (for example, to perform an immediate rescue, turn off a valve to control a leak, etc .) .  Please note that the coverall-type protective clothing customarily worn to fight fires in forests or  wildlands is not SFPC and is not recommended nor referred to elsewhere in this guidebook . POSITIVE PRESSURE SELF-CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS (SCBA) This apparatus provides a constant, positive pressure flow of air within the facepiece .  You should always use an SCBA certified by NIOSH and the Department of Labor/Mine  Safety and Health Administration, in accordance with:  42 CFR Part 84  requirements for respiratory protection specified in OSHA 29 CFR 1910 .134  (Respiratory Protection) and/or 29 CFR 1910 .156 (f) (Fire Brigades Standard)  NFPA 1852 Chemical-cartridge respirators or other filtering masks are not acceptable substitutes for  positive pressure SCBA . Demand-type SCBA does not meet the OSHA 29 CFR 1910 .156  (f)(1)(i) of the Fire Brigades Standard .  RESPIRATORS If you suspect a chemical warfare agent is involved in an incident, use NIOSH-certified  respirators with CBRN protection .'\n",
            " 'N95 respirators are the most common of the seven types of particulate filtering facepiece  respirators . This product filters at least 95% of airborne particles (0 .3 microns), but is not  resistant to oil . N95 filtering facepiece respirators do not protect against gases and vapors . Powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR) force ambient air through the air-purifying cartridge  or filter into the facepiece . A PAPR does not supply oxygen or air from a separate source  (e .g ., cylinders) . CHEMICAL PROTECTIVE CLOTHING AND EQUIPMENT For you to safely use this type of protective clothing and equipment, you need specific skills  developed through training and experience . This type of special clothing may protect against  one chemical but be readily permeated by chemicals for which it was not designed . Therefore,  do not use this type of protective clothing unless it is compatible with the released material .  Also, be aware that it offers little or no protection against heat and/or cold .  Examples of this type of equipment have been described as: (1) Vapor Protective Suits (NFPA 1991), also known as Totally-Encapsulating Chemical  Protective Suits or Level A* protection (OSHA 29 CFR 1910 .120, Appendix A & B) (2) Liquid-Splash Protective Suits (NFPA 1992), also known as Level B* or C* protection  (OSHA 29 CFR 1910  .120, Appendix A & B), or suits for chemical/biological terrorism  incidents (NFPA 1994), class 1, 2 or 3 Ensembles and Standard CAN/CGSB/ CSA-Z1610-11 – Protection of first responders from chemical, biological, radiological,  and nuclear (CBRN) events No single protective clothing material will protect you from all hazardous materials/dangerous  goods . Do not assume any protective clothing is resistant to cold and/or heat or flame exposure,  unless certified by the manufacturer (NFPA 1991 5-3 Flammability Resistance Test and 5-6  Cold Temperature Performance Test) . *Consult the glossary for more information about protection levels under the heading  “Protective Clothing .”'\n",
            " 'DECONTAMINATION The ways to decontaminate people and equipment can vary. If you need help with  decontamination, contact the emergency response telephone number provided on the  shipping papers or the agencies listed on the inside back cover. These resources may be  able to put you in contact with the chemical manufacturer to determine the appropriate  procedure if not otherwise available. Decontamination is the process of removing or neutralizing hazardous materials/dangerous  goods that have contaminated people and equipment during an incident .  Contamination happens in the area generally referred to as the Hot Zone . Everything and  everyone entering this zone should be decontaminated when leaving, including emergency  response personnel . This reduces the chances that more contamination will occur .  There are two main types of contamination:   Direct contamination happens in the Hot Zone .   Cross contamination happens when someone or something outside the Hot Zone  was not properly decontaminated and comes in contact with another object or person,  usually in the Warm or Cold Zone .  To decontaminate, you must:  physically remove contaminants; and/or  chemically neutralize contaminants* . The NFPA 472, Chapter 3, describes the following four kinds of decontamination . (1) Gross decontamination: Quickly removing surface contamination, which usually  happens by mechanically removing the contaminant or rinsing with water from  handheld hose lines, emergency showers, or other nearby water sources . (2) Technical decontamination: Reducing contamination to a level as low as possible by  chemical or physical methods . A hazmat team will perform this kind of decontamination .   (3) Mass decontamination: Reducing or removing surface contaminants as fast as  possible from a large number of people in potentially life-threatening situations . (4) Emergency decontamination: Immediately reducing contamination of people  in potentially life-threatening situations with or without formally setting up a  decontamination corridor . This process should be performed upwind and uphill  from victims . Responders should avoid contact with victims, runoff or spray from the  decontamination process . Emergency and mass decontamination can be done with firefighting and rescue operations  equipment . Nozzles can be put on wide-angle fog patterns and sprayed towards the ground  to create a decontamination shower . Responders can also place nozzles on the discharge  ports of engines .  Contaminated clothing and equipment must be removed after use and stored in a controlled  area (Warm Zone) until cleanup procedures can begin . Sometimes protective clothing and  equipment cannot be decontaminated and must be disposed of properly . *Chemical neutralization releases heat . DO NOT PERFORM on a victim .'\n",
            " 'FIRE AND SPILL CONTROL FIRE CONTROL Water is the most common and generally most available fire extinguishing agent  . Use caution  in selecting a fire extinguishing method, as there are many factors to consider . Water may be  ineffective in fighting fires that involve some materials .  Fires Involving a Spill of Flammable Liquids These fires are usually controlled by applying a firefighting foam to the surface of the burning  material . Fighting flammable liquid fires requires:   foam concentrate that is chemically compatible with the burning material  correct mixing of the foam concentrate with water and air  careful application and maintenance  of the foam blanket There are two general types of firefighting foam: regular and alcohol-resistant . Examples of  regular foam are protein-base, fluoroprotein, and aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) .  You can control some flammable liquid fires, including many petroleum products, by applying  regular foam . Other flammable liquids, including polar solvents (flammable liquids that are  water soluble), such as alcohols and ketones, have different chemical properties  . You cannot  easily control a fire that involves these materials with regular foam, and should use alcohol- resistant foam instead .  Polar solvent fires may be difficult to control and require a higher foam application rate than  other flammable liquid fires (see NFPA Standards 11 for further information) . Refer to the  appropriate guide to determine which type of foam to use . For flammable liquids which have  subsidiary corrosive or toxic hazards, it is difficult to make specific recommendations . However,  alcohol-resistant foam may be effective for many of these materials .  Contact the emergency response telephone number on the shipping paper, or the appropriate  emergency response agency, as soon as possible for guidance on the proper fire extinguishing  agent to use .  How you decide to control the fire depends on factors such as:  incident location  exposure hazards  size of the fire  environmental concerns  availability of extinguishing agents and equipment at the scene WATER-REACTIVE MATERIALS Water is sometimes used to flush spills and reduce or direct vapors in spill situations . Some  of the materials covered by this guidebook can react violently or even explosively with water .  In these cases, consider letting the fire burn or leaving the spill alone (except to prevent its  spreading by diking) until you can get more technical advice .'\n",
            " 'The applicable guides clearly warn you of these potentially dangerous reactions . Technical  advice is required for these materials since:  Water getting inside a ruptured or leaking container may cause an explosion .  You may need to cool adjoining containers with water to prevent them from rupturing  (exploding), or to prevent the fire spreading further .  Water may be effective in mitigating an incident involving a water-reactive material,  but only if you can apply it at a sufficient flooding rate for a long period  .  Products from the reaction with water may be more toxic, corrosive or undesirable  than the product that caused the fire . When you respond to an incident involving water-reactive materials, take into account:  existing conditions, such as wind, precipitation, location and accessibility to the incident  availability of agents to control the fire or spill Because there are variables to consider, base your decision to use water on fires or spills  involving water-reactive materials on information from a reliable source . For example, consult  the material’s manufacturer through the emergency response telephone number or the  appropriate emergency response agency listed on the inside back cover . VAPOR CONTROL Limiting the amount of vapor released from a pool of flammable or corrosive liquids is an  operational concern . It requires proper protective clothing, specialized equipment, appropriate  chemical agents and skilled personnel . Before you engage in vapor control, seek advice on  tactics to be used from qualified personnel . There are several ways to minimize the amount of vapors escaping from pools of spilled  liquids, such as special foams, adsorbing agents, absorbents, and neutralizing agents . To  be effective, you must select a method for the specific material involved, and use it in a way  that mitigates, not worsens, the incident . Where specific materials are known, such as at a manufacturing or storage facilities, the  hazardous materials/dangerous goods response team should prearrange with the facility  operators to select and stockpile these control agents before a spill . In the field, first responders may not have the most effective vapor control agent for the material  available . They will be more likely to have only water, and only one type of firefighting foam  on their vehicles . If the available foam is not appropriate, they will probably use water spray .  Because water is being used to form a vapor seal, care must be taken not to churn or further  spread the spill during application . Vapors that do not react with water may be directed away  from the site using the air currents surrounding the water spray . Before using water spray  or other methods to safely control vapor emission or suppress ignition, get technical advice  based on a specific chemical name .'\n",
            " 'BLEVE AND HEAT INDUCED TEAR BLEVE (BOILING LIQUID EXPANDING VAPOR EXPLOSION) The following pages present important safety-related information on BLEVEs, including a  table, to consider in a situation involving Liquefied Petroleum Gases (LPG), UN1075 . LPGs include the following flammable gases:   UN1011 - Butane  UN1077 - Propylene  UN1012 - Butylene  UN1969 - Isobutane  UN1055 - Isobutylene  UN1978 - Propane A BLEVE occurs when a fire impinged or damaged tank car fails to contain its internal pressure  and explodes with a sudden product release . This catastrophic failure is more likely to occur  with damaged pressure tank cars, even in the absence of an active fire . The main hazards from a LPG BLEVE are:  Fire: If the released substance is ignited, there is an immediate fireball .  Thermal radiation: At a distance of about 4 times the radius of a fireball, the heat  radiated from a fireball is enough to burn exposed skin in 2 seconds . Wearing protective  clothing limits the thermal radiation dose .  Blast: A concussive force caused by the sudden release of the pressurized substance .   For a BLEVE occurring out in the open, the blast strength at a distance of 4 times the  radius of a fireball can break window glass and may cause minor damage to buildings .  Projectiles: Tank failure can throw metal fragments over large distances . These  fragments can and have been deadly . The danger decreases as you move away from the BLEVE centre . The furthest-reaching  hazard is projectiles . For a video with information on critical safety issues concerning BLEVEs, please visit   http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/tdg/publications-menu-1238.html  .  HEAT INDUCED TEAR (HIT) A heat induced tear (HIT) is a rupture of a NON-PRESSURE tank car containing flammable  liquids when exposed to the intense heat of a fire . The metal will soften and the pressure in  the tank car will increase which can lead to containment failure . The tear generally occurs  at the vapor space (upper side) of the container, venting large quantities of flammable liquid  and vapors at high speed . A fireball and an intense heat wave will occur . Compared to BLEVEs, HITs rarely result in the projection of tank car fragments . Heat induced  tearing has occurred within 20 minutes of the derailment and as long as 10+ hours following  the initial fire .  Responding to these types of incidents (BLEVE and HIT) requires specialized training,  equipment and a tactical approach .'\n",
            " 'BLEVE – SAFETY PRECAUTIONS Use with caution . The following table gives a summary of tank properties, critical times,  critical distances and cooling water flow rates for various tank sizes .  This table is provided  to give responders some guidance but it should be used with caution . Tank dimensions are approximate and can vary depending on the tank design and  application . Minimum time to failure is based on severe torch fire impingement on the vapor space  of a tank in good condition, and is approximate .  Tanks may fail earlier if they are damaged  or corroded .  Tanks may fail minutes or hours later than these minimum times depending  on the conditions .  It has been assumed here that the tanks are not equipped with thermal  barriers or water spray cooling . Minimum time to empty is based on an engulfing fire with a properly sized pressure relief  valve . If the tank is only partially engulfed, then time to empty will increase (i .e ., if tank is 50%  engulfed, then the tanks will take twice as long to empty) .  Once again, it has been assumed  that the tank is not equipped with a thermal barrier or water spray . Tanks equipped with thermal barriers or water spray cooling significantly increase the  times to failure and the times to empty .  A thermal barrier can reduce the heat input to a  tank by a factor of ten or more .  This means it could take ten times as long to empty the tank  through the Pressure Relief Valve (PRV) . Fireball radius and emergency response distance is based on mathematical equations  and is approximate .  They assume spherical fireballs and this is not always the case . Two safety distances for public evacuation . The minimum distance is based on tanks  that are launched with a small elevation angle (i .e ., a few degrees above horizontal) .  This is  most common for horizontal cylinders .  The preferred evacuation distance has more margin  of safety since it assumes the tanks are launched at a 45 degree angle to the horizontal .   This might be more appropriate if a vertical cylinder is involved . It is understood that these distances are very large and may not be practical in a highly  populated area .  However, it should be understood that the risks increase rapidly the closer  you are to a BLEVE .  Keep in mind that the furthest reaching projectiles tend to come off in  the zones 45 degrees on each side of the tank ends . Water flow rate is based on 5 ( √capacity (USgal) ) = USgal/min needed to cool tank  metal. Warning: the data given are approximate and should only be used with extreme caution .   For example, where times are given for tank failure or tank emptying through the pressure  relief valve – these times are typical but they can vary from situation to situation .  Therefore,  never risk life based on these times .'\n",

Additionally,  for CBRN incidents occurring:  within the United States, call the National Response Center at 1-800-424-8802  within Canada, call CANUTEC at 613-996-6666 (1-888-226-8832)  within Mexico, call CENACOM at 555128-0000 extensions 36428, 36422, 36469,  37807, 37810  in other countries, consult page 392  The following is general guidance and does not serve as specialized incident response training .   Do not enter the scene without appropriate training and equipment . First responders can use the following information to make an initial assessment of a situation  they suspect involves criminal or terrorist use of chemical agents, biological agents and/ or radioactive materials (CBRN) . To help with this, the following paragraphs have a list of  observable indicators that a CB agent or radioactive material has been used or is present .  This section ends with a Safe Stand-Off Distance Chart for various threats when improvised  explosive devices (IEDs) are involved . DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND RADIOLOGICAL AGENT Chemical and biological agents as well as radioactive materials can be dispersed in the air  we breathe, the water we drink, or on surfaces we physically contact . Dispersion methods  may be as simple as opening a container or using conventional (garden) spray devices, or  as elaborate as detonating an improvised explosive device . Chemical incidents are characterized by the rapid onset of medical symptoms (in minutes  to hours) and easily observed signatures (colored residue, dead foliage, pungent odor, dead  insects and animals) . Biological incidents are characterized by the onset of symptoms in hours to days . Typically,  there will be no characteristic signatures because biological agents are usually odorless and  colorless . Because of the delayed onset of symptoms, the affected area may be greater due  to the movement of infected people . Radiological incidents are characterized by the onset of symptoms, if any, in days to weeks  or longer . Typically, there will be no characteristic signatures because radioactive materials  are usually odorless and colorless . Specialized equipment is needed to determine the size of  the affected area, and if the level of radioactivity is an immediate or long-term health hazard .  Because it is impossible to detect radioactivity without special equipment, the affected area  may be greater due to the migration of contaminated people .'\n",
            " 'The most probable sources would not generate enough radiation to kill people or cause severe  illness . In a radiological incident generated by a “dirty bomb,” or radiological dispersal device  (RDD), in which a conventional explosive is detonated to spread radioactive contamination,  the primary hazard is from the explosion . However, certain radioactive materials dispersed  in the air could contaminate up to several city blocks, creating fear and possibly panic, and  needing potentially costly cleanup .
